# Java <Badge type="tip" text="Java" />

Java is the fourth programming language I've learned. I first started learning it by doing exercices from Intellij. \
Then, I used it to make a [TicTacToe](../projects/Java-TicTacToe.md) game.

## What is Java ?

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language renowned for its platform independence and widespread usage 
across 
applications. Known for "Write Once, Run Anywhere," it's widely used in enterprise, mobile (Android), and web 
development, thanks to automatic memory management and strong community support.
