## What is Javascript ?

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language for web development. As a client-side scripting language, 
it enables dynamic content and interactivity in web browsers. JavaScript is essential for creating modern, responsive 
web applications. With support for both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, it allows developers to 
build a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex, interactive web platforms. JavaScript is also 
commonly used on the server-side (Node.js) and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it a fundamental 
technology in the web development landscape.
