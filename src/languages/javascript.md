# JavaScript <Badge type="tip" text="JS" />

With JavaScript, I learned how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) \
to make interactive Website .

Which helped me to make the [grade calculator](../projects/grades-calculator.md) project. Which was originally a pure
JavaScript project, then we switch to React, a JavaScript framework
<br>

Framework used
- [React.js](https://react.dev)
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/)
