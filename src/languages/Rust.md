# Rust <Badge type="tip" text="R" />

Rust is the third programming language I've learned. Despite having some basics, it has helped me gain a better
understanding of how logic works, thanks to its strict syntax.

I used Rust to make a [Todo list](../projects/rust-todo.md)

## What is Rust ?

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on providing performance, memory safety, and concurrency without 
sacrificing low-level control over a computer's hardware. Developed by Mozilla, Rust is designed to be fast, reliable, 
and secure, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from operating systems to embedded systems and web 
development.
