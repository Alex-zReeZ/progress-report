# Slim <Badge type="tip" text="PHP" />

I got the occasion to use Slim in my [Slim todo list](../../projects/Slim_Todolist.md) project. 

## What is slim ?

Slim is a lightweight and flexible PHP framework designed for building web applications and APIs. 
With a minimalistic approach, it provides easy routing, dependency injection, middleware support, 
error handling, and compatibility with various template engines. Slim is known for its simplicity, 
speed, and versatility in creating web solutions.
