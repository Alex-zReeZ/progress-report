## How I used it 

I got the occasion to use React on the [grade calculator](../../projects/grades-calculator.md).

## What is React js ?

React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, React simplifies the creation of 
interactive UIs by using a declarative approach. It allows developers to design reusable components, making it easier 
to manage and update complex UI structures. React's virtual DOM optimizes performance by updating only the changed parts 
of the actual DOM. With a strong ecosystem and community support, React is widely used for building efficient and 
scalable web applications.
