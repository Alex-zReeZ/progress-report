## What is PHP ?

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language widely used for web development. Known for its simplicity 
and integration with databases, PHP is open-source, platform-independent, and supported by a large community. It offers 
various frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, making it a popular choice for building dynamic web applications.
