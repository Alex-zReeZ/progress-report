# Steriparc <Badge type="tip" text="WP/React" />

## What is the project purpose ?

I am currently working on at ergopix. Ergopix is a Swiss company specializing in the sterilization and maintenance of medical instruments. They offer a range of services to healthcare professionals, including sterilization, repair, and maintenance of surgical instruments and medical devices. Steriparc aims to ensure that medical instruments are safe, reliable, and compliant with industry standards.

What I did is not the current website, but I created a clone of the website in view ot replace the current website using WordPress Rest Api with ACF plugin, using react to display the frontend.

## How did I do it

Using WordPress as a headless CMS, I fetched the data using the WordPress REST API and displayed it using React. Creating custom post types and custom fields using the ACF plugin to manage the content of the website.

## You can find the real [Website here](https://www.ergopix.com)
