# Web integration <Badge type="tip" text="Html Css" />

## What is the project purpose ?

The purpose of this project was to recreate a website page from a figma mock-up converted to pdf,
to upgrade our HTML and CSS knowledge.

## What it look like

![what the webSite looks like :](../images/Home%20Page.png)
This is the template of the website we had to recreate. But we had to fix it. As you can see there are some mistakes in the design. 
Unaligned text, box different size, etc...

## How did I do it ?

Create a simple directory with an HTML and CSS file with a picture directory. \
Then I just started to create the website from the PDF image we had.
