# Scolcast <Badge type="tip" text="Drupal 10" />

## What is the project purpose ?

Scolcast is an educational podcasting platform designed for schools and educators. It allows teachers and students to create, share, and listen to audio content related to various subjects. The platform helps integrate digital media into learning, making it easier to access educational resources in an audio format.

This project is a remake of the old version. The version Iâ€™m working on has not yet been deployed or put into production. My task is to create the page templates and develop scripts to import data from the current version.

## How did I do it

For this project, we used durpal 10, scss and bootstrap 5
