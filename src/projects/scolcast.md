# Scolcast <Badge type="tip" text="Drupal 11" />

## What is the project purpose ?

Scolcast is an educational podcasting platform designed for schools and educators. It allows teachers and students to create, share, and listen to audio content related to various subjects. The platform helps integrate digital media into learning, making it easier to access educational resources in an audio format.

This project is a remake of the old version. The version Iâ€™m working on has not yet been deployed or put into production. My task is to create the page templates and develop scripts to import data from the current version.

## How did I do it

For this project, we used durpal 10, scss and bootstrap 5

## Operational Competencies Acquired

The need for this project was to recreate the Scolcast website using Drupal 10 as the CMS. The goal was to improve the site's performance, user experience, and finally to give a little update to the old website template.

First I needed to analyze the existing website content structure and create the new content types and taxonomies in Drupal 10 to match the old website. I also had to rethink the user information architecture to adapt to the new legal constraints.
