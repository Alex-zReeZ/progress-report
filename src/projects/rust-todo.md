# Rust todo list <Badge type="tip" text="Rust" />

## what is the project purpose ?

This project was made to use the Rust knowledge that we acquire by doing the exercises proposed by Intellj.


For the realisation of this project, I use [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## How it look like

![Rust Todo in command line](../images/screen-rust-todo.png)

## How did I do it

You simply need to creat a new Rust project

```shell
# Rust project creation 
cargo new folder_name --bin

# Execute program 
cargo run


```

And then start developing
