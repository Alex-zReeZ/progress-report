# BDRP <Badge type="tip" text="Drupal 9" />

## What is the project purpose ?

The BDRP (Banque de Ressources de l'Ã‰cole pour les Jeunes) is a resource bank created by the school to provide younger students with educational materials, tools, and support to help them in their learning journey.

This project was designed to provide teachers with a platform to share and store the exercises they create, enabling them to access and use worksheets from other teachers for more efficient practice.

The version I work on is not yet deployed, but my task was to fix the style errors, and displaying other data.

## How did I do it

For this project, we use Drupal 9 using scss and bootstrap 5 for the style.
