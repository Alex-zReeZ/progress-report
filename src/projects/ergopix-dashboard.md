# Ergopix dashboard <Badge type="tip" text="JS | PHP" />

## What is the project purpose ?

This project is part of my work; itâ€™s a dashboard that every employee can use to clock in and access various modules we use daily. My task was to carry out a complete redesign of the project.

## How did I do it

I used React and PHP, with many modules built in PHP to generate custom JSON responses containing the necessary data, which were then fetched and used in React.

## Sadly you can't find the anywhere
